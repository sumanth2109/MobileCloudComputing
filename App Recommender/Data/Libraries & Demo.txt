Aviary Effects Grunge Pack, 4.3, 6905, 200, 39, 12, 5, 32, Very user friendly great app love how you can put the plugins to work and you see the results as you go no problems at all with my phone payments or downloads if you have problems your phone is too old, Good The filters for this app are really nice I just wish that the borders some of the filters come with would be optional because often they are just unnecessary for me and disrupt the photo, Great job Wish Aviary would come out with more full sets of effects and frames even stickers So far Aviary is the best app I've found out there Thank you for that

Dynamic Pads SwipePad add on, 4.2, 2661, 203, 65, 49, 17, 15, Needs a better product description , 4.Took me forever to figure out how to use this app, great but needs polishing I really LOVE swipepad and switch apps a lot so I also bought dynamic pads, Good application Good application for "quick" switching between running apps However on Samsung Appolo I5800 it has a lag few seconds long

Aviary Effects Archetype, 4.6, 1039, 23, 3, 1, 1, 1, Again Not at all worth the price, Amazing once again, It's a good idea

Camera Block Spyware protect, 4.7, 80, 41, 7, 0, 0, 2, Nice app Hope this confirms hack proof against hack camera activities, Couldn't wait Was going to wait for android 4.3 and the new features but what the hell Best app ever, Worth the investment Keep one of the two notification status icons active if you like to take pictures to quickly disable/enable

Photo Collage Effects, 3.5, 433, 78, 22, 14, 12, 38, Couldnt open to browse a picture It seems it doesnt support s4, Don't waste time This is rubbish Don't waste ur time on this garbage, This is ok but not good as pic art so there u no that is suck but it is awsome

Password Safe Pro License, 4.8, 163, 149, 19, 4, 0, 2, Great App but poor support The website contains a broken link for support (at least when I tried it in Chrome) and many snarky comments about users who are unable to read, Great application One of my most used apps and the UI overhaul was overdue and it's improved the app a lot, Excellent App Have used this app for over a year now and it has never let me down It is well thought out and easy to use Highly recommended

SGS3 Easy UMS Support4Dev, 3.7, 303, 24, 3, 0, 0, 12, Perfect USB STORAGE switcher mod Does as advertised Switches external microSD card access from UTP MEDIA SHARE to USB STORAGE DRIVE (better access for power users) forth and back, Finally one that works I thought I'd never find something to play my music in my car (most stock radios seem to be designed for ipod alone)Well look no further, It's a donation app Read the description before buying If you rate this 1 star it probably means you're an idiot

Bluetooth Low Energy Enabler, 4.8, 7, 6, 2, 0, 0, 0, Great app works perfectly App works perfectly and has enabled Bluetooth Low Energy on my Nexus 10 running Android 4.4 KitKat, An absolute necessary tool for Galaxy Nexus and others It's somehow hard to understand why BLE is disabled on devices that have BLE hardware, unless it's on purpose, Useful tool This app proved invaluable when I was stuck with a Nexus 7 (2012) brand new Android 4.3 but no Bluetooth Low Energy support

Donate for Defy CM10, 5.0, 176, 032, 2, 1, 0, 0,  It was a great relief to move from the stock ROM 2.3.6 (Israeli "Orange") to CM10 of Quarx, Jelly Bean on Defy Looks great thanks for all the hard work I had cm7 and I'm really liking the jelly bean nightlies, Thanks for your hard work mate Thanks for your hard work mate just a small payback towards all of your sleepless nights working on Defy CM10

Classic Text To Speech Engine, 3.8, 12185, 4551, 1606, 751, 270, 1554, Lovely Overall its good But sometime it sounds like oliver wants to cry would have given 5 star if you guys can give the jarvis(iron man AI) as well Cheers, Very limited The app only reads what you copy and paste into a box that's impractical under Android, All voices are boomy low register (bass) All voices have to much low frequency and when played through a good car stereo its annoying and hard to understand 

SpeechSynthesis Data Installer, 4.1, 143216, 149443, 56727, 32881, 8912, 21527,  I downloaded an app on my mytouch 4g and it needed this speech thingy to be installed to work,  Dear app developer This app is always getting uninstalled unknowingly, Quick install but quicker to uninstall It went into download easy as pie and real quick but anything I download from this site will pop up insufficient data space and has been a total waste of my night and all this trouble to find mileage time on Maps BOGUS
