reddit sync pro, 4.8, 1477, 4453, 848, 89, 28, 33, Remember kids This is the PRO version Not for rookies This is only the greatest reddit app ever made So if youre ready for the big leagues get this app, This thing managed to turn me away from bacon reader which I loved so very much If you doubt my word try the free version first and find out your self how awesome this app is, This app could be five stars if it integrated the swipe up to get out of a picture like Facebook does Hitting the back button constantly is a bit annoying But still this is the best reddit app on Android,News

Google Play Newsstand, 3.4, 70344, 9008, 2540, 1725, 863, 5483, App crashes upon launch after update in 4.1 environment. Works ok after uninstalling update Still buggy though Ie screen will revert back to original page view while zoomed in to see text, I am completely entrenched Makes news a dream and seeing all my favourite sites formatted so beautifully could even bring a tear to my eye, Happy with the new update and interface I like the uniformization that Google is doing On my nexus 4 its smooth and stable Only one thing there is no way to remove currents,News
