Tapatalk Pro, 4.2, 7336, 6539, 3054, 770, 426, 865, Love this app It is the best and Ive read comments complaining about having to purchase the newest build All I can say is that of youre a member of multiple forums its worth the price, Ive been a user since the beginning and for the last year or so each update brings new features and further complications to the point the app is now almost unusable, Excellent Very good app I use it mainly to access xda developers however I have seen many useful forums via the app Would recommend to anyone Sometimes lags here and there but overall nice experience,Social
Find My Friends, 4.4, 21608, 149923, 5853, 1727, 493, 955, Big problem with location Samsung Galaxy S3 very happy with performance of this app, Easy to use and much more robustness and functionality than tbe iPhone equivalent Great for the whole family to find each other, Great app but doesnt work when I need out to I love this app when it works I have my kids in my family circle but it seems that the app is always losing connection with on of them So it doesnt do me any good In addition son had a Windows phone and it was not compatible with this app,Social
TweetCaster Pro for Twitter, 4.4, 10035, 12135, 4927, 1068, 410, 585, Using this because Twitters own app is a hot mess But this isnt that much better You cant see who starred you only RTs Also it is very cluttered with too many buttons Also paid version is minimally customizable not worth $$, Excellent app So many functions in a twitter app User friendly as long as u figure out all the functions, Always been the best Not many Twitter apps left thanks to their ridiculous API restrictions but TweetCaster has always been the best one,Social
Robird, 4.4, 959, 637, 212, 82, 26, 34, One of the best Just found out about this app and already it is one of my favourite Twitter clients Its got a great look is smooth, fast and feature rich Doesnt seem to pick up all replies and interactions to tweets when I compare it to my current Twitter app, All it needs are a few more features to make it more well rounded and robust and itll get a perfect score from me Very fast smooth and stable Lots of great features already,Social
TextNow, 4.3, 17799, 8303, 1517, 973, 422, 805, This app sucks I tried to answer a call and it didnt show up and I missed a lot of calls and when I try to call it calls but they cant hear me and I cant hear them, A Very good app but sometimes ill get txt but it will show up a few min later or when I miss a call but dont hear it ringing other then that a good app, The best texting app Ive ever gotton I like how its organized Its very pretty get the app its a very great app,Social
Plume Premium for Twitter, 4.3, 3072, 2688, 830, 302, 191, 276, Horrible with api limits This is pathetic with the new update Used to love the app Now its complete crap Cant even actively use twitter without the api bs showing up Fix it please, this app is fabulous but need to know who favor my tweets In addition I need to identify whether a such account is an official account, Lots of upgrades though that seem to be fixes Its not as if Im seeing any new toys,Social
Twitter, 4.0, 1034032, 714470, 207500, 117258, 55951, 176470, Its a very cool app but anytime i switch off my mobile i always have to fill in my username and password again and again I really dont like it Fix it, The update now will not let me upload tweets with pics attached Always says failed My account favorites random tweets of people I do not evenk follow All tweets of a person does not show up on the profile on mobile some are missing that show up on the actual desktop site I used to love twitter Its a hassle now, Not cool to block third party apps like Falcon Pro that are better than yours You should work on improving yours instead,Social
Facebook, 3.7, 5412203, 4487600, 1397706, 1018557, 524116, 165081, Recent update The recent bug fixes have not worked in fact they have made everything worse Please fix whatever you have done as my facebook keeps crashing, So irritating that the like button wont work Ill like something and my feed would scroll up by itself and Ill go back to what I was liking and its not liked, Better than before There should have been Copy function too so that any story or status update could be copied,Social
Friendcaster Pro, 3.7, 11596, 5458, 4027, 1755, 946, 1769, Used to be my favorite app Has been buggy for over a month Doesnt show news feed after multiple uninstalls and reinstalls Still doesnt work ith this app Even though I paid for this Im uninstalling this garbage It never works correctly there is ALWAYS an issue with this app and Im sick of waiting for the devs to fix this app Not getting any notifications unless I go to the actual app constant error messages, Push Notifications used to work sometimes but now they dont work at all I really liked this app because of the pop up notifications Now that they dont work Im thinking of uninstalling Please fix I also use TweetCaster Pro, The free app worked so well that it convinced me to purchase the pro version Huge mistake Huge The pro app wont even log in to Facebook By the time one figures out that the app is junk its too late for a refund Genius,Social
