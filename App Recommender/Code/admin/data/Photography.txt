A Beautiful Mess, 4.5, 107, 81, 9, 10, 4, 3, Great App Been waiting for ages for this app to finally come to android and Im very excited about it It works great on my s3 and I love using it. Only 4 stars because I find it a bit over the top to charge every single bonus Id prefer if you could at least buy sets for doodles textures etc and not charge every single unlock Apart from that Im very happy this has finally come out Great job, Really upset that I paid for a beautiful looking app only to have it close every time I try to open a photo or go back to the choose a collage screen when Im in that mode Please fix, Worth the wait Ive been waiting a long time for this app to come to Android and it does not disappoint,Photography
Camera ZOOM FX, 4.4, 135237, 34535, 12360, 3362, 1524, 2405, This app has pretty much every bell and whistle you could ask for on a phone It worked great on my last phone but not so well with the new phone specifically the front camera Ive already sent the info off so I hope the next release has a fix for my phone, My nexus 5 seems to take terribly dark shots compared to stock camera but shutter speed does seem faster, I just wish the goofy stuff was all optional since I have seriously never felt the need to use it,Photography
Camera Awesome, 3.4, 1479, 126, 75, 61, 49, 68, One of the biggest features I was excited for was the ability to adjust the exposure and focus separately Ive read that its been available on other devices however not on the s3 Add this and a few other features and itll be worth the $2.99 At this point I prefer the stock camera app, Great improvement with this update much faster to load and thats awesome Now a little UI refresh for us android people and I think we have a 5 star Thanks Smugmug, Good Overall good but with lack of key features like enhanced HDR and tap exposure point on my galaxy note 3 exynos it makes this app unusable for me,Photography
