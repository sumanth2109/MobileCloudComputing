CarHome Ultra Unlocker, 4.6, 2837, 852, 176, 25, 20, 27, Great app for any driver even nervous ones that get lost all the time like me It's easy to use even if you don't feel like customizing it but it has a wealth of features if you decide you want to It is ABSOLUTELY worth the money, Love it Really greater well thought out app Was looking for something like this ever since upgrading from a Motorola which had a great car dock app Thanks, Awesome Love the app I especially like the color customization as I have for about two years

aCar Pro Unlocker, 4.7, 1686, 736, 114, 21, 9, 15,  I got this app two cars ago and have used it ever since I use it religiously on every fill up oil change, and maintenance of my new car, The app is very good but if you have any problems the customer service blows The folks that reply to queries are either in another country or didn't do very well in English during high school, Love the app I have been using the free version for months and I love it I was waiting for the pro version to go on sale The moment it did I jumped on it Awesome work Keep it up

Car Locater, 4.6, 3296, 2038, 467, 135, 40, 97, Doesn't Save Location This app returns the error location not saved more often than not which renders the app useless Samsung Galaxy S3, Very good app to have Especially in my situation because I am handicap and due to my medications I forgot where I last placed it and sure enough it found my location So yes try it, Great and very useful app Used a few others but this had everything in it and vertu easy to use Hasn't failed me in the couple years I have been using it

My Car Locator, 4.4, 573, 192, 57, 13, 5, 15, My Car Locator Terrific Found my car in a mega-mall parking lot without any difficulty Great for preoccupied people like me who can barely remember whst day it is, Nice, but Great simple to the point app If only they changed that ugly a** icon which doesn't look good with the other apps and doesn't conform to google's standards, Very good Works well Doesn't conflict with any of my other apps No spam yet

Car Performance, 4.0, 262, 43, 23, 5, 2, 10, I used to use this app on my G1 but now I have a Vibrant and it will never get past Starting GPS It's a good app when it worked but so far it doesn't seem to work on Galaxy S Vibrant, Works well & very accurate Would like a PC program to download to with speed/time graphs A lap time facility would also be nice, I tried this apps it works a while for 5 minutes then later I was at 45 miles speed, gauge showing 25 to 35 then when to zero I need my money back please

Parkmobile, 4.5, 1997, 4412, 1590, 225, 68, 220, No mention of fees until you're signed up This is the typical dishonest app You have to sign up and give them all your personal information before they will tell you anything about the extra fees they charge Avoid them if you can I only used them once because I had to, Awful experience Guys you should go through the android design guidelines Even after the app update the user experience is terrible, Great App Very convenient easy to use Love that I don't have to run back to my car to add money to the meter Haven't had a problem with this app

Lyft, 4.3, 9681, 1353, 111, 45, 27, 263, I don't want to give you permission to access all of my information on facebook Why don't you have an alternative login feature Till then Uber wins, The best Uber seems to be about money lyft seems to be about ride sharing and disruption towards cabs Like lyft a lot just wish there were more drivers Love no surge pricing too, Promo code issue Trying to put promo code in when I downloaded it and don't know how to please help

Taxi Magic, 3.9, 2003, 1376, 534, 201, 128, 390, Works well for me Never had a problem Like Just remember to turn on your GPS or obviously it won't work right Good app, Taxi Magic makes it easy to schedule a taxi in certain areas I have used it a few times and it has worked well every time, I hate that it's mandatory to enter a credit card when I only pay in cash I shouldn't have wasted my time downloading this app

OneBusAway, 4.5, 1549, 2497, 758, 186, 98, 142, Good but could be great Definitely a valuable app Would give 5 stars if you could select a bus number and see its route on the map, Excellent Would have given 4 but since update that shows next bus 5, Fantastic App And it works just fine in Atlanta even though we haven't been added to the list of cities in the official description, Sometimes it can be a pain but other times it can be accurate

My Nextbus, 4.1, 571, 221, 63, 25, 23, 34, Excellent App It only failed me once and it was no big deal other than that I'm always catching the bus on time any bus around me I get accurate times awesome app, This is so much better than trying to access the site with your browser Love it The nextbus website is really clunky to use on your phone this app makes it so much easier to access, No easier to use Exactly the same as the website This app looks like its just a webview showing the web page Buttons are too narrow height wise so I end up pressing the wrong button Why use this if its no easier than the website No easy way of saving a favorite stop
