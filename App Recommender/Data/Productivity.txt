SwiftKey Keyboard, 4.6, 289378, 223291, 46139, 9493, 3982, 6290, Paid and downloaded after reading awesome reviews but not very friendly for colloqial chit chats also it never picks up names in message correctly Here does my money down the drain I am back with my Samsung Keypad Not recommended if you don't use a formal language everytime, How about an option to redesign the smiles when we hold the enter key They are not the best out there and every one got thier own smiles collection ya know, I Four keyboards but when it comes to speed nothing is like swifkey somth and mind reading I recommend it But it's sad that there's no one for Apple

A I type Keyboard Plus, 4.5, 30788, 6623, 1737, 517, 230, 368, Don't even recall a recent update which is sometimes a disaster but I can't even use this app anymore I have used most of the keyboard out There but like this one I have never seen CONSTANT force closes even after it has force closed already Anyone else with issues, I have used most of the keyboard out There but like this one I have never seen, Update Thanks for keeping things pretty much the same New style keyboards would be cool

Tasks, 4.7, 18561, 5619, 1155, 250, 83, 79, So I've been using this app for years and really love it The only problem I have with it is that there are no transparent widgets and you cannot customize the widgets in any way, I love the simple way this app works but I would really love to see it have the capacity to do repeating tasks There are several things, Effective very very very usefull and amazing user friendly application that it is so easy to use and configure but it lacks the repeat function found in GTasks and PocketList on iOs which both syncs with google tasks Cheers dev team FLAWLESS JOB

IP Cam Viewer Pro, 4.6, 23570, 6936, 1204, 344, 120, 357, I have cameras surrounding my house and have software recording any motion seen from a desktop But there are those times that I want to check to see who's at the door if they picked up the trash or if the lawn got mowed etc and that's when I pull out my phone to check, After last update pre set is no longer working Still the same issue, The author of this app is constantly updating it and making improvements Easy to use and recognizes every device Best bang for the buck I ever spent on any app

HotSchedules, 3.1, 1526, 796, 431, 381, 330, 667, This app should follow holo guidelines The UI seems cheap especially for 3 dollars comparing to other free schedule apps Oughts to show some improvement, Way better on iphone you're not able to sync you schedule to your phones calendar or set reminders on android app the reason I paid $2.99 for it please update asap, You guys have a good thing going but the error messages are killing me Spend a little money to hire a decent developer who does a little more testing Layout could be more flexible too Instead of lists think tables Shoots

Adobe Reader, 4.5, 574770, 290982, 81023, 30512, 8163, 15258, If I could give this less than one star I would What kind of bate and switch is this I can read it for free but I have to pay to convert it first I would have never updated if I knew this was going to happen This went from a 5 star app to a ZERO app, I dont understand why I have to pay to view my own documents in my email. your description clearly says adobe is free to use I use adobe because i love the idea of my doc Looking exactly the way it should on my phone but now I have to find a different reader because i refuse to pay to view and edit my own documents Ill go somewhere else now, It was awesome before the update now when ever I want to save a file I'm yold to sign up for a monthly subscription fee Just terrible I wish I could give it zero stars

Dropbox, 	4.6, 445090, 262215, 55234, 15020, 4075, 10654, I tried to upload a pic and it stated my memory was full after deleting 30 plus photos I tried once again and the same message came up I know there is no way my memory usage is too much please correct issue, I love this application I can use files on my PC Mac Droid & Kindle What's not to love, Definitely the app to go to but it would be more appreciated if they can come up with the feature to automatically sync up with mobile devices

Google Drive, 4.3, 254915, This application freezes more than any other app I've gotten Not only does app freeze my phone does as well, I love how you can now create edit documents right from your phone Google has made a lot of things so simplistic great app, It's got all the good intentions and right ideas for a great app, but it's nearly the worst fro anything related to document editing of even creating

ColorNote Notepad Notes, 4.7, 178130, 280980, 64999, 14376, 2685, 3518, This is the best little note keeper I've ever used I've have tried several no keepers but this one tops them all thanks keep up the good work, Keeps me organised my goals in check, my thoughts to do list need and wants things to do songs to buy spending ect Can't live without it and its backed up too. Hooray for this app I've been using this app for 3 years & I really like it I usebit to keep track of all sorts of things quick trips to the store kids' Christmas lists any little thing that could be put on scrap paper I always have it with me

Battery Doctor, 4.6, 95330, 110400, 26956, 6360, 1250, 2496, Found no difference after installing it Battery still discharging with the same pace or probably even more faster as it is a continuing running application in the background, Effective power manager capable of intelligently shutting down power unnecessary apps in order to comserve power for those apps most needed wgile perserving precious communication capability, It's good and all but it's Always making my phone lag I'f you could fix that It would be great
