Camera ZOOM FX, 4.4, 135237, 34535, 12360, 3362, 1524, 2405, This app has pretty much every bell and whistle you could ask for on a phone It worked great on my last phone but not so well with the new phone specifically the front camera I've already sent the info off so I hope the next release has a fix for my phone, My nexus 5 seems to take terribly dark shots compared to stock camera but shutter speed does seem faster, I just wish the goofy stuff was all optional since I have seriously never felt the need to use it

PicSay Pro Photo Editor, 4.7, 26092, 15925, 2397, 495, 137, 322, Perfect app with top notch customer support Picsay have been around since android first started and it clearly shows with the quality of this app The fact that they continue to develop proves this company is the amazing Thanks for the great app, Simple solid and lightweight Packs a punch I finally bought it after several months of using the free version Definitely well worth the money Buy it now and enjoy Cheers, Funny how I seem to find new uses for this app mostly photos I have taken hours of fun friends don't like what I have done to there pics can't help it I'm addicted

Paper Camera, 4.5, 90627, 16606, 4764, 1219, 368, 686, It's been a slow evolution rather than a revolution but this app seems to have settled down nicely after lots and lots of updates into something reasonable stable and functional, An awesome app Keep up the good work Yeah Facebook better know as Assbook Only idiots use it, Excellent and fun to use I have the Galaxy lll and have had no problems Do wish they would add more filters

Camera Awesome, 3.4, 1479, 126, 75, 61, 49, 68, One of the biggest features I was excited for was the ability to adjust the exposure and focus separately I've read that it's been available on other devices however not on the s3 Add this and a few other features and it'll be worth the $2.99 At this point I prefer the stock camera app, Great improvement with this update much faster to load and that's awesome Now a little UI refresh for us android people and I think we have a 5 star Thanks Smugmug, Good Overall good but with lack of key features like enhanced HDR and tap exposure point on my galaxy note 3 exynos it makes this app unusable for me

A Beautiful Mess, 4.5, 107, 81, 9, 10, 4, 3, Great App Been waiting for ages for this app to finally come to android and I'm very excited about it It works great on my s3 and I love using it. Only 4 stars because I find it a bit over the top to charge every single bonus I'd prefer if you could at least buy sets for doodles textures etc and not charge every single unlock Apart from that I'm very happy this has finally come out Great job, Really upset that I paid for a beautiful looking app only to have it close every time I try to open a photo or go back to the choose a collage screen when I'm in that mode Please fix, Worth the wait I've been waiting a long time for this app to come to Android and it does not disappoint

Photo Grid Collage Maker, 4.6, 290232, 447751, 123076, 27640, 4573, 6472, this app is just simply great there are so many features and options to choose from and its really easy and simple to use, i Like it No I love it It helps me to edit the ugly photos and make it more beautiful Waaa this is nice But I hope more cute stickers to update, Nice app simple to use lovely grids and stickers Perfect app for the novice

PicsArt Photo Studio, 4.7, 564817, 866570, 164909, 45435, 11345, 22649,  I just want a best photo editor but no one best recently download this app my waiting is over, I thought of making my pics professional but couldn't find any thing then came across this app nd it worked to its best, I love It but i hate your cropping when u add a photo u have to color it in and if you don't do it right your added photo looks ugly

Pic Collage, 4.5, 97678, 32161, 6936, 3117, 903, 1685, On the whole its realy good But I really love the stickers and mabye you should make the Best Friends Forever Valentines's Day 2013 free Peeps would be happy, I love it how it makes my pictures look more beautiful and i love it, I use wattpad and I recommend this for making covers Although cutting is not so good Stickers and fonts r cute tho

Photo Editor, 4.5, 117556, 33487, 7253, 2944, 876, 1735, I had this removed it for another option and realized I can't live without this one as well Does everything a good, basic photo editor should (color correction, rotation,) and a few things advanced editors do (drawing, text, spot blurring) and does them very well and very quickly I will definitely recommend it, I've tried about 15 Android editors some good some poor This one gets 5* from me Not the simplest to use but it's worth the effort, getting to know it, I had lot of fun with this app very usefulll very nice tiny packet with great features

Flipagram, 4.6, 1514, 3272, 513, 157, 63, 123, Keeps foreclosing when sending to instagram Add delete ir back space button when making the creation instead of starting all over Picture slide moves too fast, It's cool and all but each time I try to share with Instangram it crashes I'm not sure if it's a defect with this app or their app, Recommend This to everyone is really fun And no problems so far Great app
