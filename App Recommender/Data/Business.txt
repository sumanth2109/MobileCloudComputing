NADA Marketvalues, 3.6, 48, 5, 1, 0, 0, 9, Kind clunky but very useful Highly useful and very worthy of purchase Definitely helped with car shopping Interface is kind of clunky and it takes a crazy long time to open But it easily paid for itself when the bank undervalued our car and was going to charge an extra 1.5% on the loan, Excellent I have tried this on several vehicles and love how it gives so much info on each It beats flipping through the book I can book out vehicles exponentially faster using this app, Horrible I got the app an it does nothing but force close
