WeatherBug Elite, 4.5, 13665, 33754, 10380, 2446, 1148, 2045,  Feels like doesn't work and never has It should give the humidex reading but all it shows is the temperature which we already know If you live in a humid location you want to know the humidex or as you call it feels like which should include wind chill in winter, Wow vast improvement on the GUI I like a lot The only thing I wish is that I could scale the amount of animation frames as in the old version, This app used to be problematic But phones have gotten much better and this app Has grown with them

Clean Master (Cleaner), 4.8, 720081, 2120726, 413305, 71575, 9016, 11688,  I love this app it helped me clean up my phone delete and unplug wasteful apps and even poems me to move recently downloaded items to sd card as I often forget to The only down side to it is that there is no option to continually keep wasteful apps off, Last update has improved it compared to how it was behaving recently It's now better at boosting up the phone's memory, I was so ignorant keeping all the junk unknowingly and thought my smart phone has become dull time to change it But Clean Master is super With this App my phone has become smarter Thank you Admin
