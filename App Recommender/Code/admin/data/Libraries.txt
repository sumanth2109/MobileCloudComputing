Password Safe Pro License, 4.8, 163, 149, 19, 4, 0, 2, Great App but poor support The website contains a broken link for support (at least when I tried it in Chrome) and many snarky comments about users who are unable to read, Great application One of my most used apps and the UI overhaul was overdue and its improved the app a lot, Excellent App Have used this app for over a year now and it has never let me down It is well thought out and easy to use Highly recommended,Libraries
Bluetooth Low Energy Enabler, 4.8, 7, 6, 2, 0, 0, 0,  An absolute necessary tool for Galaxy Nexus and others Its somehow hard to understand why BLE is disabled on devices that have BLE hardware, unless its on purpose, Useful tool This app proved invaluable when I was stuck with a Nexus 7 (2012) brand new Android 4.3 but no Bluetooth Low Energy support,Libraries
