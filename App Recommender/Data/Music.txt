Pandora, 4.5, 469419, 787932, 177130, 58658, 24858, 53546,  Since the update it erase every artist I had on here and now I cant even search for any artists it says my pandora time has ran out what is the point on having itif it wont work, Why would you guys remove the sleep timer?! What a dumb idea, Pretty decent until an update prevents me from using it on the road. I used it constantly then it just quit working while driving. I've gotten a new phone no change. Great idea poor implementation.
Shazam, 4.5, 413206, 402199, 85729, 26398, 8588, 24021,  YouTube playback no linger working correctly. App to slow to load. Can we have the original version back yet, Shazam is fast and always finds Spanish songs even the less popular songs. Love it and it Works great
iHeartRadio, 4.5, 141544, 205580, 38157, 10991, 5012, 12594,  Love this app! So convinient and smooth. I just hate the commercials that you can't skip that come on once in a while. It's free so I can't complain that much, I absolutely enjoy this app. This is the best hands down radio app Great work peeps, I love the so cool it has all my favorite music
TuneIn Radio, 4.5, 361291, 263651, 57230, 17749, 6220, 12374,  It vibrates to the music playing which annoys me. Aside from that, fantastic for any radio station you can think of, Where's the exit button gone. Since the update there no way of shutting the app down and its draining my battery. It needs sorting asap. Or ill have to delete the app, However since updates it never consistently plays anymore. It sounds like a scratched cd or kicks out to buffer constantly. Fix back to the app I know and love and I'll go back to 5 star. Hands down best music app. Access to any possible radio/internet station you can think of
Spotify, 4.0, 306630, 126982, 32336, 15599, 8643, 28565, Spotify is the absolute best, Still lacking All these updates and STILL no search history. The app feels a little outdated, Real Nice Just excellent! Would be nice to have track info over Bluetooth
SoundCloud, 4.4, 111851, 53065, 13115, 5592, 2254, 4833, Good app Keeps saying there's a problem but its still pretty good, I love this app I like so much this app i thing its 1 of the best in play store. Pls make it more easy to use and with better look. Work so good i dont have any bugs or errors, Great app! Love soundcloud and I also love app.
Poweramp Music Player, 4.6, 153758, 243148, 38007, 13136, 4683, 10984,  I dont like it. Every time play a song it skips and crash. When i download a song it cant find it to play it,  This app have so many functions and it is still easy to understand it. I can't imagine listening to music with original player any more, Good app everything works how it says but i have to use an external eq just because its a little choppy but other than that its great plays mp4 as mp3 and is perfect 5stars!
Google Play Music, 3.8, 566239, 159707, 53906, 32052, 16677, 48988, Every time it goes to another music the volume goes way down that I can hardly hear. It's definitely an app issue as this only happens with Google Music. Galaxy Note 3, Only thing I would like to see is a white widget option to match the new 4.4 theme otherwise works well for me,  The app runs perfectly! Just fix the equalizer because some options glitch the tracks a little
Slacker Radio, 4.0, 117755, 67536, 23360, 9779, 5116, 17812,  I am really pleased with the different varieties this app has to offer. Even more pleased with all the bands they have on the rock station. They even play songs you never hear on the radio which makes me happier! Definitely one of my everyday used apps and would recommend very highly,  Love the favorites station way better than Pandora, all I can complain about is that I'm tired of the Flo commercial, Would give 5 stars if it did not search for the network service when I had great cell coverage
Amazon MP3, 3.5, 141063, 50180, 18134, 9462, 3954, 31360,  Was my goto music player but after update does not work right any more. No sound even though music is playing, Easy to use I like the cloud option for my android, Just randomly pauses during songs and starts over. Need another bg fix please. Dig the look though
