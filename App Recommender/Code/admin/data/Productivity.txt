A I type Keyboard Plus, 4.5, 30788, 6623, 1737, 517, 230, 368, Dont even recall a recent update which is sometimes a disaster, I have used most of the keyboard out there but like this one I have never seen, Thanks for keeping things pretty much the same New style keyboards would be cool,Productivity
