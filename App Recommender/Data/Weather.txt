WeatherBug Elite, 4.5, 13654, 33754, 10829, 2446, 1148, 2045, 13654, Feels like doesn't work Feels like doesn't work and never has It should give the humidex reading but all it shows is the temperature which we already know If you live in a humid location you want to know the humidex or as you call it feels like which should include wind chill in winter, Excellent Android weather app Pretty much perfect in every way, except the only map it has is Doppler radar Don't need the others much though so I'm very happy with it, Accomplishes desired tasks but Buggy pulling from top down Force close more often than I would like Hourly doesn't change to reflect actual

BeWeather & Widgets Pro, 4.3, 7890, 3555, 1278, 336, 185, 310, Best Weather App so far I have tried many different weather apps Other then my Garmin Real Time HD satellite weather subscription on my boat this app works the best Much rather the paid app The ads can obscure the view on crucial info, Very good Only problem I have is the in app writing is hard to see when some of the videos are playing an option to put a transparent background behind just the weather details would be helpful, Still my fave But wish it had a summary page for all my saved locations to view at a glance rather than swiping through each one to see

Eye In Sky Weather Pro Key, 4.5, 2108, 362, 73, 21, 17, 23, Best weather App by far Don't bother searching for anything more accurate or well designed Icon packs to match any them, Great but Great app good functionality good graphics But it's missing one feature the ability to select what weather service to use This would be a great feature at least for my area as the built in weather service seems to be a bit off from the weather that happens more so than other weather apps Add an option to select the weather service then this would definitely be a 5 start app, Bring back old colours As mentioned below the new icon colours in yow are too dark I preferred the white clouds Otherwise great app

Notification Weather Premium, 4.4, 546, 380, 127, 38, 11, 35, Nice but more customizations Nice app but hope you can implement the option for user to adjust the size of the weather picture and the text in the notification Separate the primary color and the weather picture color Option to allow what to be displayed Option to remove the refresh button Make the left and right alignment text better Option to remove what will open when clicked instead of going into settings or an app just blank,  Best weather app out there it updates with new and better features often best purchase I've made so far Very good and improving, This is a great app and is improving constantly Just wish the font might be a bit larger for the temperature in the notification bar

Phases of the Moon Pro, 4.9, 2082, 1222, 127, 19, 1, 8,  It's an OK app to keep track of the moon's phases, but developer's need to listen to feedback and make changes as they are suggested Ie moon phase names accuracy etc,  Fun Nice way to follow the Moon through its phases Would like to see descriptions of the types of Moon such as waxy etc That information would give it a 5 star rating Very nice accessory, Excellent App Does everything it says it will Customer service was great too I emailed the creator and had an answer within an hour Thanks alot for an App that really does what it claims

RadarNow, 4.3, 13765, 17278, 5704, 2002, 869, 16622,  Loved this app right up to the last update in early July I find it is now unusable as an efficient and usable radar app It doesn't remember zoom when you do zoom radar image is terrible and pixilated How could this happen to a great app Update has fixed my issues, This excellent little app just seems to keep getting better I'm amazed at the way it automatically jumps to the nearest available radar when you move your location on Google maps It's always been able to track your movement via gps as you drive and now to automatically update radar location as you plot a route on Google maps is brilliant 5 stars--well deserved, i work outside and this was one of my most used apps it was quick easy to read and very user friendly its still an ok app but the update just took too many steps in the wrong direction just too slow

Weather, 4.6, 70666, 109097, 34377, 8811, 1495, 2098,  Read Reviews before installation And had installed several before this one and had so many problems, The best weather app I have used Its fast accurate and great layout If I knew how to design apps this is how I would design a weather app I realize ads help pay for it but they can be bothersome, So far so good The location should be more precise It would be also good if we could configure how often the app should update the temperature This are the reasons why I just give 4 stars

World Weather Clock Widget, 4.4, 16283, 13456, 5621, 1739, 456, 711, Very nice This is the widget every one should Have on there fone but the alarm drains all the battery fix this for 5 stars, Excellent Very handy and useful app Shows weather with rain/wind info plus clock could not have asked for more in settings changed the background of weather display and it became cool,  Hey tis app is fantastic I luv it Like everything about tis app especially having da choice to set it on your home screen Everything is right in front of u Dnt have to leave home screen to see everything Would be great if app would automatically refresh location for weather

Marine Weather by AccuWeather, 4.1, 594, 414, 188, 63, 31, 79, Doesn't work anymore It's asking me to upgrade Google play services The thing is there isn't new version for my android OS please fix it, Just got a new phone and redownloaded the app and now tides and local weather stations are not there in the free app Lame, Great app which I use daily for fishing Newest version did not play well with previous so had to uninstall and then reinstall to get weather forecasts back Lots of good info for any marine related activities

Transparent clock weather, 4.5, 18010, 17458, 7158, 1684, 477, 629, This app has all I need and more but only thing is that the bottom is cut off and I cannot read the system info Tried to make larger but to no avail Other than that app is perfect Thanks, App is working great since the latest update I was having an issue with the weather not updating I was just receiving a N/A Problem fixed with the update, I love all the different ways that you can customize this app The different colors fonts all the system info i need on one widget amazing and cool Great look for my homescreen thanks
