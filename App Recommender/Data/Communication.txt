FoxFi Key, 3.7, 16291, 2396, 385, 215, 199, 944, Okay I love being able to use this even just tethering cause I KNOW its free. Buy my question is how do I know if I'm getting charged to use the hotspot through verizon, Finally giving up Doesn't work on new T-Mobile phones Worked for about a month now I'm giving in Wish I had went with my gut and not paid for this Don't be fooled by the ploy their customer service is non-existent,  I'm able to connect the Wifi Hotspot from my Kyocera Rise to my Windows 8 HP Laptop but it says there is connection problems and when I diagnose them on my laptop it says the Wifi hotspot does not have a valid IP Address I don't know what I can do to fix it

Mobile AntiVirus Security Pro, 4.5, 77585, 9000, 2053, 588, 237, 535, I purchased this quite a while ago and was not a subscription app For AVG Does this mean that those that purchased it before the change will be grandfathered and not have to pay or will this another case like the inclusion of ads in some of your premium products that were added without the knowledge or consent of the user and we'll be forced to pay again, Just had a shocker with this app used the lock function and on my mobile was asking for a password that I thought was my antitheft password how wrong I was can't get into my phone so had to do a hard reset and lost everything have to start over again so please beware of this I have emailed avg tonight regarding this but was scary stuff indeed, The best I use AVG on computers I sell, and give it to my customers Great for devices with limited RAM. Should be preinstalled on all smartphones

Tablet Talk, 4.4, 7076, 2343, 843, 221, 97, 188,  My only complaints are the inability to send pictures when connected to my phone via wifi, and frequent dropped signal from phone,  Brilliant app I now barley use my phone for anything since getting this a few days ago Use the Bluetooth connection and you are always able to use the tablet Can't quite give it 5 stars because after a while many hours/days my devices won't connect, I've been using this app for about 6 months now and very minimal issues with it Love the fact that I can leave my phone charging in any room and be on my tablet and get my texts

Titanium Media Sync, 3.7, 3691, 584, 287, 154, 118, 217,  I receive an error every time Reported via support e-mail address no response Paid for an app that doesn't work Not impressed, The ui is straight forward The automation is wonderful Dropbox however does not sync with this current version It errors out with no explanation as to why I could use other file services but my evo lte came with 25 gigs of Dropbox space so that is my preferred, No problems encountered so far but only 4 stars because there isn't an in app way to stop the sync service

Better YouMail, 4.2, 719, 321, 88, 31, 19, 58, I have been a BetterYouMail user for about 2 years When I upgraded to Kit Kat all of a sudden my app wasn't working But the YBM tech team was amazing They were totally dedicated to fixing the problem It took about 24 hours of emails back and forth (as late as 11 PM one night) until they found a fix and now I'm back to being happy again! I'm so impressed with their persistence in helping me and coming through,  I don't know if it has to do with KitKat or if it is just due to a fresh installation but I'm getting high battery use with the latest version and contact list integration enabled, Great app Does not display every call Voicemail is nice with several options

iDisplay, 2.9, 2716, 240, 219, 152, 124, 366, works fine but bad resolution in vertical mode  and 3d issues I'm using this on the Nexus 7 2013 edition through USB The default resolution was too slow but bumping it down works fine however google chrome (which uses 3d acceleratoin) doesn't refresh correctly on that, There is some lag but it works well enough to be useful and is surprisingly useful Make sure that you enable USB debugging and install the USB driver properly USB is more laggy than WiFi but it does work hopefully this will be fixed unless it is a hardware bottleneck,  This is a waste of money for android and windows users All t will do is mirror your computer screen if you have windows 8 Where does it say this in the description or website? NOWHERE! It lags really bad too All I wanted it for was a screen extension in a pinch but now I just burned $5

facebook Messenger, 4.3, 1548106, 831655, 217643, 107538, 36522, 96892, Already read chats shouldn't re notify App shouldn't notify about the chats I have read on web already, only when I want to message friends The old version of messenger had it but right now I have to hit force-stop from settings->apps, Poor update Why do I always have to press on continue to verify that it is me everytime I go to my messages The app is connected with facebook right so it means when I'm the one who's logged in to facebook then i'm also the one using messenge

Skype, 4.0, 1671121, 896682, 239718, 138777, 69098, 229391, Not compatible for ipad & android tab users I am using galaxy tab3 while a friend is using apple ipad We tried using this app for a video call He can see me but what i can see from his incoming video is his forehead only, Never syncs properly Mobile Skype seems to be full of bugs After login it shows me already read message notifications Logs out automatically when not seeing the phone or using other app, Even if you just use a Skype ID it still doesn't work I was logged in via desktop and Android app at the same time Called my Skype number from another phone Desktop version showed an incoming call but no such thing from my Nexus 5 that was running the Skype app

Yahoo Mail, 4.0, 335248, 241611, 100509, 45135, 21676, 54965, 33524, Links not working When I try to click on a link from my email it really works And ok for train certain emails to my Gmail so I can access the links Otherwise I just look at yahoo mail on the web browser Also on on regular mobile signal I noticed the mail does not update correctly Will still have email showing that I already deleted on my PC, Emails don't always load (monthly issue) Once a month for a 3 to 5 days my emails won't load even when I try powering off my phone and after clearing the cache as instructed This is quite a nuisance since I use this app to check email on a regular basis, This app has so many bugs that it gets very annoying to use Sync This app has so many bugs that it gets very annoying to use Sync issues and invisible mails occur far too often for my liking That will be why there are so many updates At least it's free

GO SMS Pro, 4.4, 437108, 585856, 169189, 62257, 19551, 34506, COULD you please explain to me why I can't receive any pictures or video COULD you please explain to me why I can't receive any pictures or video I didn't see anything that would let me reconfigure so I could receive pictures or video That's the only problem I have with this program, I like The app gives you options you don't get with regular messaging I personally appreciate versatility it affords with messaging The only drawback is having the "upgrade" fees it should be a totally free app, Great App! Love the graphics! I have the Note 2 and I still can't get the giant flower to come up no matter how many times I try and follow the instructions. But I still love them all
