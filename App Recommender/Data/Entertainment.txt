Sketch Book Mobile, 4.5, 33972, 7684, 1900, 512, 219, 423, Best one of its category But they seem like they stopped working on it, the colour picker is missing, instead of a circle with the colour picker there's just the fill icon Tried it on my nexus 7 and xperia tablet z and its the same Just found out how to get the picker you have tou tap twice on the brush at the top of the screen in the options mode, Very unhelpful One missing feature All I need is an option to change the canvas size (the width and the height) Once this small but significant option is available I will upvote this to 5 stars

4Shared Pro, 4.4, 29703, 680, 155, 55, 14, 67, Worse than the free version I can't even search for any movies or books because it just says error No way I want a refund There is no difference between this pro version and the free version, No Useful Help With Login Issue Been contacted by support but they just insisted I have the wrong login information I'm reiterating that I login using my Google access information, Very good But hate I can't find more songs from early 2000s It have almost most of the songs Manage 4Shared files About all its good for no subfoldr create 

Talking Tom Cat, 4.4, 112089, 4901, 952, 332, 153, 514, Nice Fun for the kids keep then busy for that walk through the store Bloatware is ruining It My kids love this app but it and the other talking critter games are getting too bloated The kids get the old devices witness room and everytime oneof these Apps updates, Furious really upset Please fix awful problem I was so excited about this app sounded so fun Everything was perfect and I was ready to give this game five shimmering stars but then I tried chatting with Angela I completed one of the offers but when I clicked on the letter icon it crashed I tried again and again but it only closes on me I can't tell you how devastated I am this isn't fair, Don't download isn't worth it Please fix as I am thinking about uninstalling Did the of offer 3x and never got it Omg now no offers Im sorry but if i dont get my chat with Angela im gonna report this android boostmobile Why I have to downloaded 230 MB as the additional data?

RadioLab, 2.8, 654, 116, 47, 51, 113, 122, Hard to low vote this Love Radiolab and am super happy to support but this app leaves something to be desired Quits often Force closes if it doesn't just quit It's so frustrating to be enthralled by a story only to have the app die Fix please, Beware will consume data when on wifi I listened to one podcast while at home on wifi I don't know how but the app managed to consume 100 MB of my phone's mobile data running background processes even when wifi was enabled I am not looking forward to this month's phone bill, Love the program hate the app Love the program but think the app is hard to navigate Doesn't show download queue or progress which is kind of disappointing too Do a lot of downloading so I can listen while I travel and am without a connection and think the app could show download queue and progress so you know it's working

Talking Ben the Dog, 4.1, 70253, 1491, 332, 149, 84, 288, Would rate 0 if I could Having ads on a paid app is disgusting and inexcusable The developer(s) count on kids tapping on the ads Hope your proud of yourselves, Don't buy! Paid version comes with ads You are bloody kidding me We pay for it and you have ads and pop up Even on child, Sensation Pay for the app to get rid of adds so my 2 year old don't press the wrong buttons and still adds for other apps on there get rid of them If I want other talking apps I will look for them Please remove or have setting to remove then will give it more stars Just as good as other Talking Apps but for some reason but my 1 year old really dislikes 

The Moth, 2.9, 37, 8, 0, 2, 8, 5, I already liked the moth podcast but I wasn't able to listen to the Radio Hour on my phone This app makes it finally possible It works flawlessly so far It has a very beautiful design too It is well worth the purchase considering the hours of stories you'll be able to get for your buck Plus you get to help a non-profit organisation, Crashes Needs work As others noted the app looks good but it suffers from serious problems right now It frequently crashes during playback of longer episodes like the radio hour Also when I download longer episodes to listen offline these sometimes do not play at all but begin a crazy kind of shuffle through the other shorter episodes I've downloaded, I wait for it to play or it usually force closes and freezes big time please fix Had to uninstall for now I'd love to reinstall this app and finish a story

NetFlix, 4.1, 479731, 308442, 67667, 26713, 14691, 60386, Downloading Fails I keep downloading the app to my cell phone which is an android all it does is either say its downloaded and installed and then not open or say error I dont know if its my phone or the app I see no reason why it would not download though, Can't select profile I have different profiles on my account and the app automatically defaults to the first one There's no way to be able to choose another profile bc my main one is for kids I want my profile on my,I love this app It's really smooth and the controls are really responsive The only thing I would add is support for Samsung's multi window feature like YouTube That would be a welcome addition to its already lengthy list of supported hardware I think lately my Netflix app has been skipping I know it's not my device because my Hulu app never skips I would appreciate it if you looked into it More content Netflix in general needs to increase there movie collection a lot especially in there weak areas like anime and current tv shows Also the app on android doest allow me to switch to my profile
