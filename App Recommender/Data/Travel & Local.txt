BackCountry Navigator PRO GPS, 4.5, 7295, 2035, 472, 86, 55, 130, Best Only app I've ever wanted to pay for Worth every cent, Nice app and the best topo app I have found I really like the map caching options but the app often fails to cache the maps so it takes multiple dowload attempts and force closes and also has problems importing kml and gpx files, Awesome App I use this app to track our off road trails for our Jeep Club Works great with my HTC Sensation and Google Nexus 

GPS Navigation & Maps offline, 4.1, 6047, 2015, 1072, 320, 103, 361, This app is simply The Best navigation app there is for android and I've tried most of them Fast easy and offline Maps are always up to date Very gentle on the battery as well, Better but Its better but it lost GPS signal and it missed an exit and I had to switch back to a different GPS Second time I used it the same way it didn't happen I will test it when I go abroad to Germany and when I have to go to work, Best in class I've tried many and settled on this one Simple logical modern looking Workflow is great Replacing Google maps for navigation My only wish to have font size adjustable and wouldn't mind more details on maps but that's minor

FlightBoard, 4.2, 2079, 308, 98, 43, 25, 32, Developer not good Their other application flighttrack pro I have purchased previously Now they ask for payment again to upgrade to newer version how many times we have to purchase their applications They ask for money after every update it seems Google should take action against them, nice idea poor execution widget puts my phone into airplane mode when I touch it doesn't have airport code right refresh button doesn't work all issues on so widget, Each time I used this app it crashes and closes unexpectedly I'm in trouble with javalangnullPointerException

NAVIGON USA, 3.2, 1395, 273, 157, 93, 61, 245,  Exactly what I have been looking for Putting in the addresses are a lot easier too Better then google maps The only thing I am need to get use to is how the street namds are labled Other then that Great work GARMIN, ok i need my money back please people no waste your money on buy this bad application, Maps are not life time Very poor system Map showed I was .5 miles away from destination voice told me I have arrived Very disappointing interface

Military Survival GPS MGRS, 4.8, 139, 13, 3, 0, 0, 0, Works App works had a little trouble at the start but no big deal, GPS does not turn off after you close the application Because of what the battery goes down quickly and remain without communication and compass, App works had a little trouble at the start but no big deal

Google Earth, 4.5, 333744 , 166647, 37847, 12108, 3803, 10732, Very poor This app used to be 100 times better I used to be able to go to street level and then follow the road to wherever else I wanted to see, i love google earth btw I wonder why most latest google apps like youtube and earth do not respect the Auto Rotate Screen Off setting Its really annoying You guys should enforce your own standards, This update freezes on my phone every time The older version worked quick and without a hitch

Yelp, 4.4, 58196, 58292, 28739, 6749, 1855, 3212,  This update freezes on my phone every time The older version worked quick and without a hitch, Love the yelp app It really is so easy to look up a restaurant reviews and put in your own review The discounts at check in at done some places is great too 4 stars because I think there should be a spot where we can report check in discounts not being honored Aside from that this is perfect, Yelp is great hasnt let me down yet I could never imagine going on a vacation without Yelp

Maps, 4.3, 1405157, 1878473, 515592, 209157, 77268, 211388, Okay so you fixed all the irritables I had with maps Here are your 5 stars PS love the thumb-tap and slide to zoom in/out, Need a postal address to save I used to track various offroad locations but recent updates have moved all these to the nearest postal address in one case almost half a mile Smart move Google you've screwed with user data, App is continuously being updated The latest update for Android phone is missing the 3D-ish rotating map in Navigation mode The moving 2D map is much more difficult to use when you are lost on winding roads Please bring it back

GPS Navigation, 4.0, 25257, 4027, 1004, 510, 218, 932, Not working After the trial was over the app just stopped working It wont make connection with the satelites Even when it was working it never showed my location right it was constantly jumping from street to street and starting to move in the opposite direction, Not working Just try and you will see Don't take numbers of the addresses I wish to tell you the problem but not place to send the info Then the program is useless, Trying to navigate my way out of Boston downloaded this app and set it up gave it a destination address and all I got was a white arrow moving around on a black screen Waste of time

Fly Delta, 3.6, 10736, 2389, 1390, 676, 531, 1106,  My favorite app ever Easy to use updated regularly secure fast easy great design absolutely awesome Delta is the ONLY airline I fly, Essential if you fly Delta much at all Much quicker and easier to deal with check in and boarding passes in particular compared to a mobile browser, Very difficult to navigate through the site Not the least bit intuitive Takes much too long to load each page Works about once out of three times
