SkyDroid Golf GPS, 4.5, 4075, 2434, 765, 174, 86, 132,  I've used this app since the very first version I see an issue that I don't recall was present before, Does exactly what you want it to very easy to use Can kill a battery but that isn't the app's fault that is having gps and screen on for 4 hours while running data, Very good but for a few things The online scorecard editor is terrible it doesn't work It's virtually impossible to input your courses pars if the app doesn't have it

Ski Tracks, 4.2, 2839, 118, 43, 14, 3, 19, A must have for all skiers No data connection required and a great amount of fun trying to beat your top speed, Only suggestion is to have an option to attach a picture that you already took in the phone, Love it I never knew anything like this could work without service Great way to track vertical feet and number of runs All this for 99¢ I would have paid more for sure

Soccer Scores Pro FotMob, 4.6, 3942, 1018, 228, 50, 29, 47, With the latest update to 9.0.3 it's back to being the best app for soccer updates in the Google Play Store, This is the best updates quick I've tried all numerous times bit this is the best, Works really well and keeps me well informed of all the latest scores as I'm on the go

PinPal, 4.2, 101, 45, 11, 7, 3, 6, Great app for keeping up with your games and stats Would like it if you could download info into a word document or other program for future reference and to look at/print out, Almost Perfect I have bought all of the available bowling tracking apps on the Play Store and this one is the best, Very happy now that I am able to enter just final score on my phone Small glitch with it which the developer has been working to help me with

Yahoo Fantasy Sports Football, 4.3, 20884, 60822, 30731, 6221, 2286, 4650, I am getting the same error message everyone else is getting Worked just fine till the update Maybe you should check you're work before rolling it out to everyone, It does not work service error I can not play fantasy football thank you It does not work service error I can not play fantasy football thank you Yahoo you suck, Love it now that it works Works again so once again I love this app Please be sure to not screw it up with the next update

ESPN Radio, 3.1, 6300, 1134, 322, 239, 332, 1032, Awesome app Never had a single issue or glitch Listen to sports radio all day at work Thanks guys, Why can i listen to the world series but if i try to listen to the local stations without wifi the app just crashes and lags the heck out of my phone, I've been using this for over two months and haven't had any problems or noticed any bugs Very user friendly

WRESTLING, 3.7, 1026, 186, 19, 15, 17, 73, This is the most ridiculous game I have ever seen Hate it, Most interesting game, Is a good game, No wonder it downoads so quick

Golf Channel Mobile, 3.6, 4252, 1115, 651, 336, 214, 515,  App no longer opens force closes all the time tried installing and reinstalling several times, Good amount of golf news, but you can't disable the stream notifications that pop up throughout the day Very annoying,  I really like all the information in this app but It will not play the videos

Sports Media Player, 3.1, 213, After reading all the Horrible comments I figured the app wouldn't work but took a chance anyways and IT WORKS PERFECTLY,  Can't play audio unless you leave the app open and screen on for 4 hours to hear the game, Complete wast of money. please refund my money
