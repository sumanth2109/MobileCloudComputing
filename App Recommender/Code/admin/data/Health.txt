Endomondo Sports Tracker PRO, 4.5, 54021, 44067, 14493, 2366, 1159, 2325, Poor after new update Ive been using this app for the last one yr and all was ine until the new update Previously I could use the app freely with out logging in Now its mandatory to log in and at times I do not have the Internet connection to do just that and this app is deem redundant, Endomondo can no longer locate GPS at all Thats hideous Now, on top of required logins and "premium" services that half of which belong in the paid app,Health

The Blood Type Diet, 4.2, 314, 74, 30, 6, 1, 12, Handy app Does what it says on the tin Only problem is that it seems to have an issue displaying labels and other text on a Galaxy Note 3,  Will rate it 5 stars when options for non-secretor are added Would also like it if I could pull up recipes as part of the app rather than being directed to the website which displays in very small text on my phone, I wish I had the book back I used to have the actual book but it got lost during a move I was super excited to see there was an app until I actually tried to use it,Health
The Wonder Weeks, 4.1, 356, 47, 20, 4, 4, 8, Limited Not a great deal of content in this app it mostly serves as an advert for the book What there is is interesting though, Accurate Surprisingly accurate especially the stormy phases, The app works fine,Health
