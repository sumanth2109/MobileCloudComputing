MyChart, 3.9, 1934, 594, 175, 68, 46, 194,  Don't understand the low rating. Works as advertised on my phone. Able to access MyChart functions much easier now that I don't have to wait to get to a computer. Notification function would be great addition though, Galaxy S3 won't even open Keep getting a security error where it is unable to contact the server then the app auto closes, Does not include my clinic and can't be used without selecting a clinic. If you're not in a big city with a big system and don't download. 
Medscape, 4.4, 9649, 9111, 2157, 576, 247, 1044, I am a medical officer in underdeveloped country working in rural area without internet access. This app helping me a lot in treating my patients. It is equally empowering my medical knowledge. It is the best app till date for me. Kudos to the developer. Hope we can see the images soon without accessing internet, Excellent review tool for quickly referencing drug dosage, side effects and interactions plus having access to Medscape's review articles is always a plus, An excellent app for all those interested in the healthcare profession.	This app consumes much of your mobile phone's resources but it contributes much to your and other's well-being. It deserves a five-star rating
