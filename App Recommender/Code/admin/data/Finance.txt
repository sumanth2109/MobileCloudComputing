Verizon Uasge Widgets, 4.3, 435, 77, 10, 5, 6, 9, Works great Works on my Nexus 7 connecting to my wireless boadband account My only suggestion would be to have a user configuration to set frequency of updates I only need an update once a day I dont want to use more data than I have to I have a 10GB / month cap which can go quick over a 4G connection This is perfect for keeping track of usage, Great but But resizing the widgets makes the text go outside of the image I like it I like it I mean it could have a refresh button instead of having me log in all the time lol and better graphics But other then that its cool and helpful as Lord knows what, Great App Must have for Verizon customers This is 100 times better then the official Verizon widget First you dont have to login each time and its compatible with other devices not on the Verizon network.
