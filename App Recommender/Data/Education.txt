Monkey pre school, 4.4, 3692, 489, 134, 29, 18, 38, Great app This is a good app My 3yr old loves it I think if u added different levels to make it more challenging it would make it perfect, Great app My five and three year old love this Would be great if there was level of difficulty as they progressed and if they could save their stickers, Great! My younger sisters love this game My only suggestion is that it should have a difficulty setting and that if the game could save their stickers in their own profile  only suggestion is being able to adjust the difficulty because now that she's played it so much it seems easy to her but she still loves it and plays it
