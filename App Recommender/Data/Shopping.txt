Out of Milk Pro Unlocker, 4.5, 3598, 1001, 258, 65, 36, 68, I can't scanned anything I just bought this app and I can't scanned anything because it doesn't have the the scanner thing on top app like it should and one of the reasons I got it was for that I really like this app but can fix it, I use this app all the time Its great. I use it to keep up with grocery list everyday things I need. Things my kids need Its great for keeping up with what I run out of or need to do Anything I need to remember I can't imagine using any other app, Having bought the Pro key makes the program unusable The key screen remains on the phone screen and restarting the app brings me back to the Google Play store

Barcode Scanner, 4.2, 3621, 294, 68, 32, 12, 45, Nice app The app is pretty nice and seems to work faster than the free version (plus it supports a few additional codes) The only thing I wish is that they would improve the interface a little by adding a few of the tools I use all the time on the man screen, I struggled to get the app to read from an LCD screen but with the developer's help I eventually tried the Invert Scan option and it worked like a charm, I was using the free version and switched to this one problem is that after the last update it no longer scans anything The free version however works very well so what's the deal with that

Grocery King Shopping List, 4.2, 1193, 1325, 659, 201, 85, 151, Much better layout better flow as well I've had this and the other apps as well over a year Once you have many items scanned it becomes quicker and easy to add items and just alter the price, Excellent Very useful I use this on a regular basis The inventory control aspect is increasing in features and function Highly recommended, I bought the key for this and I have seen improvements in the features it has I just figured out per store prices and price comparison Not intuitive but it works There are still a few it doesn't have

Shopping Gift List Manager Pro, 4.0, 120, Soon as I bought this I started using with no problems Very simple easy clean and versatile I had no idea what I was missing out on No more confusing notes and lists I now have check boxes and easy organization Best part it saved me money on the first use, I've used this app for 2 years I've installed and tried new apps as I see them but they are quickly uninstalled because this app is just the best,  Makes it easy to plan gifts Love that I can set up group and then individuals within a group to manage family gifts

Sales Tax Discount Calculator, 4.7, 197, 55, 7, 3, 0, 1, Perfect With the addition of the 3 easily selectable tax rates (for different counties in my case) this app is now perfect, It works but would be much better if it would save your work It works but would be much better if it would save your work so you could add a price save then come back and add another, Best money ever spent It keeps the current state tax that i enter so i dont have to keep reenter it and it keeps track of what total my amout will be

Amazon, 4.5, 221560, 58124, 14490, 4262, 1238, 2838, Excellent update With the new updates it makes a good app truly inimitable to a great website Prime, and pay with points makes all things good, Great app and service but since the update my ability to choose which wish list I want to look at has disappeared There is no selecting wish lists, I am using this on an Android smartphone There is a moderate learning curve but once you get it the application is easy to use

Walmart, 4.4, 23610, 12067, 3075, 1157, 367, 855, One of the best I love this app Unlike most apps, and actually shows you the prices and its pretty good at showing the stock of your local store It always seems up to date and it's great for browsing and planning a shopping trip, Everything worked just fine until it began force closing on its own and it cleared out my cart I had a lot of stuff in there and its going to be hard to find everything I wanted Please fix, The prices r amazing The store location r great n the merchandise is to die for Wal-Mart has it all my favorite store for food household items furniture in etc

eBay, 4.4, 302756, 323417, 80314, 26898, 10088, 32309,  I don't usually comment on apps but this app has worsened Clicking on sellers other items items does not show everything they are selling Also the search is not thorough and does not find everything, As a seller I wish there was a way to differentiate in the selling notification settings between receiving a bid & actually completing a sale hearing the same default cha-ching sound for bids sales & payments can be misleading & necessitates picking up the phone to verify the type of activity, Much better than the old version but really drops the ball for notifications I don't hear about winning an auction my best offer being accepted or an item being marked as shipped all the time

Walgreens, 4.3, 62681, 19323, 4859, 1926, 890, 2463, Crashes every time I use the card maker Prescription refills are never submitted I hate Walgreens, This app is awesome it's very convenient for prescriptions luving it, love it Simple to use user friendly and I really like the auto refill options for text alerts when your prescriptions are ready and you can use your phone to be scanned for discounts if you don't have your Walgreens card, Random crashes I loved the app until it started crashing on me The crashes are interrupting other apps and causing my phone to run slowly Uninstalling the app until I am positive it will work properly

Black Friday 2013 Ads, 4.3, 15, 465, 239, 47, 23, 47, Really well made though I can tell it grabs web pages it presents everything great Page loads are snappy and the app is very useful Best of all they aren't nagging you with their own ads every 5 seconds or forcing you to subscribe to their email, I love the efficiency of this app since it provides updates on the latest sales and promotions It also makes it easy to see and compare deals It is a great companion to the website which I use,  A great app with constant and timely updates The best black Friday app I have tried
